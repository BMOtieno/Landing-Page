![anime character](https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/psh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4/images/5/3/5/8/28668535-1-eng-GB/%E3%82%BD%E3%83%8B%E3%83%BC%E4%B8%8A%EF%BC%89%E8%BF%BD%E5%8A%A0%E3%80%80%E9%AC%BC%E6%BB%85%E3%81%AE%E5%88%8320200805183428557_Data.jpg)

## Overview
The landing page consists of code written in html, css and Javascript. The html file has text written in Japanese, which can be easily translated to 
English when opened in a browser. The landing page highlights the history of anime and ventures into the relationship between caricature and culture.

## Usage
All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
A Responsive layout of the landing page is created to use across all devices.
The navigation bar is responsive too across all these devices.
Responsiveness can be verified by inspecting the landing page using the Developer Tools option on Google Chrome Browser.

## Development
Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. A for loop is made and within the loop, four list items
are assigned sections and a anchor link is attached to each section. An event listerner is added with the function that directs the user to the
section based on the 'click' event. Scrolling is added for active states using the 'scroll' event listener. This Sets the CSS class active state when the element is in the viewport.
The active section in the Navbar is highlighted as observed upon opening the Developer Tools.
